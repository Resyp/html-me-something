            Helping businesses create their brand since 2017 out of Hopkinsville, KY, caseMarketing is focused on bringing fresh ideas to provide a personal but yet professional setting to all your marketing consulting needs. I enjoy working hand in hand with small to moderately large business owners creating ways to make business goals become reality. We can personalize any marketing plan to meet the needs for any company goal or objective.

            <p>
            The Telesafe project was a fun and interesting one, and have benefitted from increased internet searches since my contributions.

            <p>
           A ton of projects were done with Ginger Creek, and looking at their site is only a fraction of the design work that I've done for them. Not including the promos, events, and other things I had a hand in creating and setting up.

                    One of my favorite projects was working with AVRetreat's design, logo, and the style of their website.
